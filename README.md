# Sentiment-Classification-in-a-Code-Mixed-Environment

According to a study done in 2021, there are approximately 43% of the population. A further 17% of people are multilingual. More than half of the world's population can speak more than one language. Another trend seen in the multilingual speaking area is that the people in the age group of 16-24 years are more likely to speak more than one language. This is the same age group that is seen to be the most active on social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

Although information retrieval systems and natural language processing systems have seemed to have gained high accuracy in the cross-lingual text classification area, the code mixed text datasets themselves seem to be very scarce. 30% of queries to Ruuh (a Microsoft chatbot) are code mixed. Alexa gets code-mixed speech inputs. Around 2-30% of posts on Twitter and Facebook are code mixed. Observing this shift in the trend of linguistics, having a multilingual retrieval model seems to be a necessity more than an added feature to a search engine. A study of 830k tweets from the Hindi-English bilinguals also indicated that the native language, Hindi was more preferred for expressing negative sentiments while English was preferred for the positive ones. These statistics also tell us that multilingual retrieval models are not only restricted to understanding the meaning of the query, but also the sentiment.
